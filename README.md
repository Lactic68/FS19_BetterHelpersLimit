# FS19_BetterHelpersLimit

In multiplayer the limit of helpers you can hire depends on the number of players online. This implies that if another farm hires helpers before yours, you won't be able to hire any more helpers.
With this mod, the limiter also takes into account which farm is hiring the helpers so that each farm can always hire the same amount of them.
